    """Handle all lobby-related logic for the online chess mode.

    This function displays the online lobby by calling
    [`showLobby`](Source/chess/onlinelib/utils.py), retrieves
    the latest player list from the server, and processes
    user inputs (e.g., refreshing the list, requesting a game).
    It communicates with the server via the provided socket,
    sending and receiving instructions based on lobby interactions.

    Args:
        win (pygame.Surface): The surface onto which the lobby UI is drawn.
        sock (socket.socket): An open socket connected to the chess server.
        key (int): Unique identifier for the local player.
        load (dict): Configuration and preferences loaded from the userâ€™s settings.

    Returns:
        int: A status or error code indicating the next action:
             - 0 if the user quits the entire application.
             - 1 if the user navigates back to a previous menu.
             - 2 if the server closes or an error disrupts the connection.
             - Other codes for advanced scenarios or internal states.
